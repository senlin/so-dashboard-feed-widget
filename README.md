###### Author: [Piet Bos](https://github.com/senlin)

The Dashboard Feed Widget shows the latest Posts from a site of your choice in the top of the WordPress Dashboard.

## Description

On websites we develop for clients we always add this widget to their WordPress Dashboard to keep them informed on general updates regarding their websites. We thought it would be a handy tool for other developers, so we turned the widget into a plugin.

The default settings are:

* the standard title of the widget box is "Recent Updates"
* as I needed a default feed URL I used the feed of SO WP, one of my own websites
* the default number of RSS items is 3
* do not open link in new tab (since v2.3.0)
* yellow background color of the widget (`#FFFF99`)

We have decided to only support this plugin through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-dashboard-feed-widget/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue here. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.
