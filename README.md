The SO Dashboard Feed Widget shows the latest Posts from a site of your choice in the top of the WordPress Dashboard.

## Description

On websites I develop for clients I always add this widget to their WordPress Dashboard to keep them informed on general updates regarding their websites. I thought it would be a handy tool for other developers, so I turned my widget into a plugin.

The default settings are:

* the standard title of the widget box is "Recent Updates"
* as I needed a default feed URL I used the feed of WP TIPS, one of my own websites
* the default number of RSS items is 3
* do not open link in new tab (since v2.3.0)
* yellow background color of the widget (`#FFFF99`)

The plugin comes localized for use on sites other than the English language and/or on bi/multilingual websites. In the languages folder you will find the .po and .mo files. Feel free to send me translations in other languages, I will then add them to this folder and of course I will credit you here.

Current translations:

* Dutch (by myself)

I have decided to only support this plugin through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-dashboard-feed-widget/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue here. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.
