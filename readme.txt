The SO Dashboard Feed Widget shows the latest Posts from a site of your choice in the top of the WordPress Dashboard.

== Description ==

On websites I develop for clients I always add this widget to their WordPress Dashboard to keep them informed on general updates regarding their websites. I thought it would be a handy tool for other developers, so I turned my widget into a plugin.

The default settings are:

* the standard title of the widget box is "Recent Updates"
* as I needed a default feed URL I used the feed of SO WP, one of our own websites
* the default number of RSS items is 3
* do not open link in new tab (since 2014.07.27)
* yellow background color of the widget (`#FFFF99`)

I have decided to only support this plugin through [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-dashboard-feed-widget/issues). Therefore, if you have any questions, need help and/or want to make a feature request, please open an issue over at Github. You can also browse through open and closed issues to find what you are looking for and perhaps even help others.
 
<strong>PLEASE DO NOT POST YOUR ISSUES VIA THE WORDPRESS FORUMS BUT ON GITHUB INSTEAD</strong>
 
Thanks for your understanding and cooperation.

== Installation ==

= WordPress =

Search for "SO Dashboard Feed Widget" and install with the **Plugins > Add New** back-end page.

 &hellip; OR &hellip;

Follow these steps:

1. Download zip file.
2. Upload the zip file via the Plugins > Add New > Upload page &hellip; OR &hellip; unpack and upload with your favorite FTP client to the /plugins/ folder.
3. Activate the plugin on the Plugins page.

Done!

On the Settings page you can change the widget title, the feed URL, the number of feed items and the background color of the widget. You will also see a checkbox that resets the settings back to the default settings when deactivating and then reactivating the plugin again.

After saving the settings, you can see the results in the main WordPress Dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does the SO Dashboard Feed Widget plugin also work on WordPress Multisite? =

No it doesn't work properly. There are other plugins that can do this more reliable for Multisite.

= I have an issue with this plugin, where can I get support? =

Please open an issue over at [Github](https://github.com/senlin/so-dashboard-feed-widget/issues/new), as **I will not use the support forums** here on WordPress.org
